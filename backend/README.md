# Foundry Tx Simulator Backend

Local Go server that accepts simulation parameters or a transaction hash, maps `chain` to an RPC URL from config, runs either the simulation test harness or `cast-kyber run`, and returns the execution trace with backend-derived fund-flow and balance analysis.

## Run

Install the pinned Kyber Foundry fork from the repo root before running local simulations:

```sh
scripts/install-foundry-kyber.sh
```

The backend expects `forge_bin: "forge-kyber"`, `cast_bin: "cast-kyber"`, and
`anvil_bin: "anvil-kyber"` so the runners use the pinned Kyber Foundry fork and
can optionally request decoded internal calls.

```sh
cd backend
go run ./cmd/server
```

To log HTTP request and response bodies while debugging:

```sh
cd backend
TXSIM_DEBUG_HTTP=1 go run ./cmd/server
```

The backend also logs simulation stages with `slog`: worker acquisition, Foundry project setup, external `forge-kyber build src`, state override compilation, Anvil start/reset, Forge test exit code, parsed trace size, transfer count, price-fetch count, and balance-analysis count. These logs avoid printing upstream RPC URLs, Etherscan API keys, calldata, or state override bytecode.

Docker is available as an optional deployment path from the repo root:

```sh
docker compose up --build backend
```

The Docker backend listens on `0.0.0.0:8080` inside the container and is published to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by `docker-compose.yml`. Local `go run` deployment is unchanged.

Override the Docker host port with `TXSIM_BACKEND_PORT`:

```sh
TXSIM_BACKEND_PORT=18080 docker compose up --build backend
```

Set the local backend listen address in YAML:

```yaml
listen_addr: "127.0.0.1:18080"
```

The server loads config from `TXSIM_CONFIG` when set. Otherwise it searches from the current working directory for `config.yml` and `config.example.yml`; direct `go run` commands from `backend/` also check the same names in `..`. `./dev.sh` uses repo-root `config.yml` by default.

Use repo-root `config.yml` for local development or `config.example.yml` as a template for another config file. The backend loads `.env` from the repo root and `backend/.env` with `gotenv`. YAML config fields only use environment values when the YAML explicitly references them with `${...}`.

Use the repo-root `.env.example` as the template for `.env`. Put secrets and machine-specific values in `.env`:

```env
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.example
BASE_RPC_URL=https://base.example
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://arbitrum.example
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=...
COINGECKO_API_KEY=...
```

Then reference them from YAML:

```yaml
etherscan_api_key: "${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY}"
rpc_urls:
  mainnet: "${MAINNET_RPC_URL}"
```

Backend runtime settings and `./dev.sh` settings live in YAML:

```yaml
listen_addr: "127.0.0.1:8080"
frontend_port: 5173
work_dir: "backend/.runs"
default_project_root: "backend/.runs/default-project"
project_cache_path: "backend/.runs/projects.json"
timeout_seconds: 300
max_concurrent_runs: 1
forge_bin: "forge-kyber"
cast_bin: "cast-kyber"
anvil_bin: "anvil-kyber"
anvil_host: "127.0.0.1"
anvil_port_start: 18545
etherscan_api_key: "${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY}"
rpc_urls:
  mainnet: "${MAINNET_RPC_URL}"
explorer_urls:
  mainnet: "https://etherscan.io"
```

Chain RPC endpoints are read from the YAML `rpc_urls` map. `explorer_urls` maps the same chain names to block explorer base URLs for frontend address links. `etherscan_api_key` is backend-side only and maps to `forge-kyber test --etherscan-api-key` and `cast-kyber run --etherscan-api-key`; set it directly in YAML or use `${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY}`. `frontend_port` controls the Vite server when using `./dev.sh`. Set `COINGECKO_API_KEY` in `.env` if you want CoinGecko requests to include a demo API key.

Simulation records are stored in a SQLite database at `<work_dir>/records.sqlite`. `project_cache_path` stores recently used Foundry project paths. `default_project_root` stores the default Foundry project. Local runs default to `backend/.runs/default-project`; Docker uses a separate `/data/default-project` volume.

`max_concurrent_runs` controls the simulation worker pool size. Each worker lazily starts one quiet Anvil fork on a distinct port, reuses it across requests, and resets it with `anvil_reset` before later runs. `anvil_bin`, `anvil_host`, and `anvil_port_start` configure the local fork processes. Keep concurrency at `1` for the safest local behavior, or raise it if your machine/RPC can handle parallel simulations.

## Endpoints

- `GET /docs`
- `GET /openapi.json`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /chains`
- `GET /projects`
- `POST /projects/default/source`
- `GET /browse/project`
- `POST /simulation`
- `POST /tx`

`GET /projects` returns cached Foundry project paths in most-recent-first order. The frontend uses it for Foundry Project suggestions.

`GET /browse/project` opens a native local folder picker and returns the selected project path. It is intended for the local frontend's Foundry Project browse button.

`POST /projects/default/source` writes one Solidity file under the default project's `src/` folder. The backend initializes the default project with `forge init` on first use.

Inside Docker, native project browsing is unavailable because the backend runs in a Linux container. Use `/projects/default/source` through the UI to work with the default project in the `default-project` volume. `~` is supported in `projectPath` and configured project roots for local runs.

  "data": "0x"
}
```

Send this body to `POST /simulation`.

`blockNumber`, balances, approvals, and token IDs should be strings when they may exceed JavaScript's safe integer range. Hex strings are accepted for uint fields.

`decodeInternal` defaults to `false`. Set it to `true` to add `--decode-internal`
to the final `forge-kyber test --json` command.

`stateOverride` is optional. When provided, the backend writes the source into the per-request work directory for local runs, or into a temporary file under `<projectPath>/test/` for external-project runs. It then runs `forge-kyber inspect <file>:<contractName> bytecode`, writes the compiled creation bytecode into the JSON input file, and executes the simulation test with `forge-kyber test --json`.

`chain` selects the upstream fork RPC from config, and `blockNumber` selects the fork block. The backend prepares a worker-owned Anvil instance with those fork settings, then runs Forge against the local Anvil RPC. The Solidity test reads the full request-shaped JSON input from `TXSIM_INPUT_PATH`.

`projectPath` is optional. When provided, the backend treats it as another Foundry project, runs `forge-kyber build src --root <projectPath>`, copies `contracts/test/SimulateTxRunner.t.sol` into a deterministic content-hash file under `<projectPath>/test/`, runs `forge-kyber test --json` against that copied test with `--root <projectPath>`, then removes the temporary test file after the last active run using it finishes. Relative paths are resolved against the backend repo root. Paths beginning with `~` are expanded to the backend process user's home directory before validation.

`compiler` is optional and maps to popular Forge compiler flags. Supported fields are `use`, `offline`, `noAutoDetect`, `viaIR`, `useLiteralContent`, `noMetadata`, `evmVersion`, `optimize`, `optimizerRuns`, and `revertStrings`. The backend only passes `use` and `evmVersion` when they are explicitly provided. The state override `forge-kyber inspect` compile and final `forge-kyber test` run default `viaIR` and `optimize` to `true`; external-project `forge-kyber build src` uses the target project's defaults unless compiler fields are explicitly set.

## Tx Request

```json
{
  "chain": "mainnet",
  "txHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "decodeInternal": false,
  "quick": false
}
```

Send this body to `POST /tx`. The backend runs:

```sh
cast-kyber run <txHash> --rpc-url <configured chain RPC> --json
```

When `decodeInternal` is `true`, it adds `--decode-internal`. When `quick` is
`true`, it adds `--quick`. When `etherscan_api_key` is configured, it adds
`--etherscan-api-key <key>`.

The response includes `erc20Transfers`, parsed directly from ERC20 `Transfer` logs in the Forge JSON arena for later fund flow graph construction. Logs emitted from delegatecall frames are attributed by walking up the arena parents to the nearest `CALL` frame, so proxy token transfers use the proxy address rather than the implementation address. Each item contains `token`, `from`, `to`, raw `amount`, and, when metadata is available, `normalizedAmount`, `symbol`, and `logoUrl`.

The response also includes `balanceAnalysis`, which aggregates ERC20 transfers into signed per-user token balance changes. It fetches token decimals and symbols from the configured chain RPC, gets current USD prices from DefiLlama and CoinGecko, and may use DexScreener only for token display metadata such as symbol/logo. Trust Wallet token logo URLs are used as a fallback when the token address can be checksummed. USD values are only calculated when both a price and token decimals are available.

Each started simulation or transaction replay is saved in `<work_dir>/records.sqlite`. The response `id` can be used later to reload the exact request and display its previous output:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/requests/20260511T120000.000000000-deadbeef
```

The lookup response has this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "20260511T120000.000000000-deadbeef",
  "request": {},
  "response": {}
}
```
